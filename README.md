## Experiences

### [Articulo Voice Bot](https://articulovoice.2359media.com/) - Fullstack Developer (Apr 2019 - Present)

**Tech Stacks:** Google Cloud Platform, NodeJS, WebSocket, Docker, Kubernetes, FluxCD, Github Actions

I used almost time of working day to design and develop new features for our product. Websocket service that connects PSTN's communication provider and NLP service, real-time tracking for call or dynamic conversation flow are some cool feature I have been improving for two years. To deal with rush deadline, I decided to use GCP services for our MPV. So, we used Firestore as main database, Cloud Functions for serverless functions and other services such as Cloud Storage, Cloud Runtime Configuration, Cloud Scheduler and so forth.

Furthermore, I developed a service that converted text-base audio to a real audio file in WAV format. Because every service in our system are containerized, so I had to research to create a Docker image that includes FFMPEG and NodeJS. Then, I used that image to operate a Queue Message System (Redis Queue) to perform the heavy task I mentioned before.

### [BotBot AI](https://botbot.ai/) - DevOps Developer (Apr 2019 - Present)

**Tech Stacks:** Docker, Kubernetes, FluxCD, Github Actions

I have maintained a Kubernetes cluster that host our system on Azure Cloud. With powerful of GitOps (performs by FluxCD and GitHub Action), we can focus on develop our without worry about deployment. I'm also a developer who suggested and applied new working pipeline that make our development process more clearly and easy to use. That new pipeline also helped improve security between different workspaces by gave them individual account role that bound their permisisons to their workspaces only,

In addition, I hosted many internal tech talks to help team members become familiar with new tech stacks. With the tech talk, I also introduce new technologies that make our product better. For example, I introduced the ETL pipeline helps transfer data from multiple input to data warehouse (Google BigQuery). Or deployed the ELK stacks that used for Log Monitoring.

### [Boomerang.Isentia](https://www.isentia.com/vi/) - Fullstack Developer (Mar 2018 - Apr 2019)

**Tech Stacks:** Docker, NodeJS, ReactJS, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, Redis, Gitlab Platform

Because of a legacy code base (NodeJS v0.11 with NodeJS Worker), I had to stand up and designed the new system. To sanctified business's requirements, I developed a new crawler platform that could be scaled greater than fifteen dedicated servers and served more than fifty thousand requests per seconds. Used RabbitMQ as Message Queue and some design patterns like Chain of Responsibility, Command and Observer pattern, I created system that is easy to maintain and extendable.

I had become a leader of small team with three junior members for six months. In that duration, I used time to help them improve their skill sets and mindset. For example, I shared why I used a tech stack in our system, how do we make the code better with Unit test and design pattern and how they manage tasks by themselves.

### Other experiences (2015 - 2018)

- [Personal Blog](https://blog.nodeplusplus.com/): I researched and practiced how to use AWS (Route53, S3, Cloudfront, Certificate Manager) with [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) to deploy my blog. I also used Gitlab CI as my continuous integration to automate the deployment process.

- [Mattresses by Serta](https://www.serta.com/) at [Tagrem Corp](https://tagrem.com/index.html): I maintained a ecommerce platform that was based on Yii framwork (PHP).
