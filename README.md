## Experiences

In this section, I only mention which projects I was proud of. They are projects that I made many impacts as member of a team or I'm in charge of the team.

### [Articulo Voice Bot](https://articulovoice.2359media.com/)

**Position:** Fullstack Developer (NodeJS and ReactJS)

**Duration:** Apr 2019 - Present

**Responsibility:** I have developed a core of our startup - a voice bot - for a year.

For infrastructure, I configured our on-premise Kubernetes clusters uses GitOps workflow that is integrated with FluxCD and Github Actions. So, I could focus on develop our services without worry about deployment because only successful release could be delivered.

For coding, I used Websocket to transfer a text-base voice between PSTN's communication provider and our services. Because the conversation between bot and customer is real-time conversation, I had to optimize many things to cut down the latency between PSTN's communication provider, NLP backend and our services.

**Tools:** NodeJS, Websocket, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, FluxCD, Github Actions

### [BotBot AI](https://botbot.ai/)

**Position:** DevOps Developer

**Duration:** Apr 2019 - Present

**Responsibility:** I have maintained a Kubernetes cluster hosted on Microsoft Azure for 6 months. In that cluster, I built a workflow that uses GitOps with FluxCD and Github Actions to automate our releases. Furthermore, I helped the Team Leader fix security problems of that cluster by reviewed and configured RBAC to restrict access to our Kubernetes Dashboard.

**Tools:** Kubernetes, FluxCD, Github Actions

### [Boomerang.Isentia](https://www.isentia.com/vi/)

**Position:** Fullstack Developer (NodeJS)

**Duration:** Mar 2018 - Apr 2019

**Responsibility:** I designed and developed a crawler that crawled three millions unique records from the internet channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Forums, News and so forth. Especially, on a high traffic day, our platform handle more than twelve millions unique records. I also lead a team of 3 junior developers and guided them how to become better developers with Design Patterns, SOLID principles and Test Driven Development.

**Tools:** NodeJS, ReactJS, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Gitlab CI

### Other experiences
