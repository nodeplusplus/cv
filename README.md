## Experience

### 2020

#### [Articulo Voice Bot](https://articulovoice.2359media.com/)

**Position:** Fullstack Developer

**Responsibility:** I've been developing for a bot for 8 months. That bot helps our clients automate low-value work so that their staffs can focus on the higher value tasks. By using powerful techniques from GCP we can add more cool features like:

- Interrupt Flow: Answer customer question right after they ask instead of waiting for the bot finish sentence itself
- Realtime Tracking: See how the bot anwser customer questions in realtime
- Custom Voice: Use our custom voice instead of default voice options from Amazon or Google.

**Techniques:**

- GCP platform: Firebase, Dialogflow, Compute VM, Cloud Functions, Cloud Schedule
- Websocket
- Speech To Text

#### [BotBot AI](https://botbot.ai/)

**Position:** DevOps Developer

**Responsibility:** I've been maintaining our CI/CD. Because our system is base on K8s, so we decided to use GitOps as standard of Continous Development. Finally, most of developers can deploy their applications (both Frontend and Backend) easier than by just a commit or pull request.

#### Boomerang - Social Listening

**Position:** DevOps Developer

**Responsibility:** I've maintained a crawler system that use more than 30 dedicated servers.

The heart of our system is 10 dedicated servers that process crawl requests from the Redis Queue. In the best day, we could perform more than 20 million crawl requests to got about 12 million records from social channel such as Facebook, Youtube, Intagram, News, Forums, ...

We used 2 Elasticsearch clusters to store our data so that we could perform full text search queries in our data lake easily. In our main data lake, we used [hot-warm architecture](https://www.elastic.co/blog/hot-warm-architecture) to get best performance. That data lake costs us 13 servers and stored more than 15 terabytes text.
